### What is Babs  Burger Bonanza?
Babs Burger Bonanza is a fictional small company located in the Puget Sound Area that is interested in providing high-quality gourmet burgers across the region and beyond. Babs Burger Bonanza currently delivers burgers through its two food trucks that appear at popular locations on a regular schedule as well as catering to events on a contracted basis. In addition to their food trucks, Babs Burger Bonanza has a small office / warehouse that is used to manage supplies and the overall operation of the business. The owner, Babs Fontina, has approached our consulting company to help them leverage technology in order to provide improved quality consistency in their product, to increase their productivity in delivering burgers, and to allow them to expand the service without compromising their core business model.

Living in the Northwest and making money from previous startups, Babs knows that technology can be leveraged across all aspects of their business even though the only computing technology currently being leveraged is focused on the core business operations related to accounting, payroll, warehouse inventory, scheduling, and payment. Babs would like to use technology:
* to improve daily operations of the food trucks (such as inventory, location, food preparation, sales, cooking, and delivery),
* to improve customer service and interactions,
* and to manage logistics as they look to expand their operations.
